atfsff = Another Tool For ScaFFolding .

(the name of this project was inspired by ANTLR = ANother Tool for Language Recognition)

Tool to generate artifacts that support CRUD (create, read, update, delete) of a JPA entity. 
Yes! another invention of the wheel you can find here!

This project is based on :

* Generate code (HTML, JS, JAVA) for JPA entities  (+ custom annotations defined in the project) 

Also I'm thinking of add a security module in which you can add access controls to the JPA entities.
